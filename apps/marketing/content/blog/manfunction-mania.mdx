**‚ò¢Ô∏è We're calling a MALFUNCTION MANIA!**

**üö® Documenso 1.0 is in the [testing enviroment](https://documen.so/test)**

It's been a minute since Lucas proclaimed [‚ÄúWe're doing a rewrite‚Äù](https://documenso.com/blog/why-were-doing-a-rewrite) and many of you have been asking, when the new version will be available. I‚Äôm happy to say that the wait has come to an end. The work on Documenso 1.0 has reached a level we feel comfortable going into the next phase with. We had a lot of community feedback, contributions and moral support to get us this far, which is why we're excited to announce the biggest commnity project yet:

As Documenso 1.0 just hit the testing environment, we're calling a "MALFUNCTION MANIA." A big, public testing phase, where we invite everyone to try out the new version, hunt down, report and fix any and all malfunctions (aka bugs) and give feedback before release. Malfunction Mania will happen alongside our own internal testing and by combining the two, we want to ensure the best possible release we can have for Version 1.0. We know that many of you have been eager to contribute and this is your chance (the first of many to come).

## As part of Malfunction Mania, we're offering special bounties

- $50 for reporting serious issues in a reproduceable way;
- $100 for fixing reported or other critical issues via accepted Pull Requests (PR);
- Exclusive Merch: Every worthy contribution to Malfunction Mania will be awarded the Limited Edition ‚ÄúSignature Look‚Äù Shirt.

## What you can do

- Head over to the [testing environment](https://documen.so/test), check out the new version and give it a spin;
- Check out the [source code](https://github.com/documenso/documenso) on GitHub and look it over;
- Spin up the new version locally and try it out.

## How to get the bounties

- Report bugs by creating an issue here: [documen.so/issues](https://documen.so/issues);
- Fix bugs by creating a Pull Request (PR);
- Look over and add missing documentation/ Quickstarts and other useful ressources.

We don‚Äôt have a specific end date for Malfunction Mania. We're roughly planning to move the test version into the production environment end of the month, once we're happy with the results. Bug reports and fixes are of course always welcome going forward.

We're building an open-source alternative to DocuSign.
