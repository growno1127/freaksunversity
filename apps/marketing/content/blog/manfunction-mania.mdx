**‚ò¢Ô∏è We are calling a MALFUNCTION MANIA!**

**üö® Documenso 1.0 is in the [testing enviroment](https://documen.so/test)**

It has been a minute since Lucas proclaimed [‚ÄúWe are doing a rewrite‚Äù](https://documenso.com/blog/why-were-doing-a-rewrite) and many of you have been asking, when the new version will be availible. I‚Äôm happy to say, that the wait has come to an end. The work on Documenso 1.0 has reached a level we feel comfortable going into the next phase with. We had a lot of community feedback, contributions and moral support to get us this far, which is why we are excited to annouce our biggest commnity project yet:

As Documenso 1.0 just hit our test environment, and we are calling a ‚ÄúMALFUNCTION MANIA‚Äù. A big, public testing phase, where we invite everyone to try out the new version, hunt down, report and fix any and all malfunctions (aka bugs) and give feedback before release. Malfunction Mania will happen alongside our own internal testing and by combining the two, we want to ensure the best possible release we can have for Version 1.0. We know that many of you have been eager to contribute and this is your chance (the first of many to come).

## As part of Malfunction Mania, we are offering special bounties:

- $50 for reporting serious issues in a reproduceable way
- $100 for fixing reported or other critical issues via accepted PR
- Exclusive Merch: Every worthy contribution to Malfunction Mania will be awarded the Limited Edition ‚ÄúSignature Look‚Äù Shirt

## What you can do

- Head over to to the testing environment at https://documen.so/test and check out the new version and give it a spin

## How to get the bounties:

- Report bugs by creating and issue here: https://documen.so/issue

We don‚Äôt have a specific end date for Malfunction Mania. We are roughly planning to move the test version into the production environment end of the month, once we are happy with the results. Bug reports and fixes are of course always welcome going forward.
